# STI interdisciplinary robot competition![Tokamak](Photos/2014-06-10%2014.18.47.jpg)This project was completed as a Master semester project at [École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne](http://www.epfl.ch).* Authors: Karl Kangur, Marcel Starein, Chun Xie* Assistants: Alessandro Crespi, Gorecki Tomasz* Professor: Auke Ijspeert## AbstractThe [STI competition](http://robot-competition.epfl.ch) is a interdisciplinary Master semester project in form of a competition between five teams of three people from different educational backgrounds. The competition's goal is to design and build a litter collecting robot and outperform the other robots. The teams are given funds in order to buy parts, order custom parts from the in-house mechanics or make use of the available 3D printers.## Project reportThe complete project report with all the documentation is in `Documents/Project report.pdf`.## Video[**Video of bottle fetching and detection demonstration**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZNW9JzXmiI)## PicturesSee under `Photos`.## Files* All documents related to the project (rules, deadlines) and the project report itself are in `Documents`* Documents related to sensors are under `Datasheets`* First concepts in Google SketchUp, final parts in SolidWorks format and custom PCBs in `Hardware`* The complete source code for the Raspberry Pi, Arduino code for the [PRsimino](https://github.com/Robopoly/prismino) and the custom WildThumper motor controller are in `Software`* Pictures of the robot are under `Photos`* The Webots files for the simulation are in `Webots simulation`
